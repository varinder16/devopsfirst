this is for the git to convert any folder to git folder we use git init in the folder then it get coverted to repositry 
we enter the folder and intialize git in it it get converted to the repositry 

then it cret an own folder in the given folder name ./git that is a hidden folder that can we fetched by ls -a it now has all the data 
and some files name as hooks and all about that git file we store in it


git has 3 area

Working Directory when i write gitadd chcek git status it show read it means it is in the working directory and not saved in the git 

Staging Area  when write git add "filename" then it has moved to the staging are means git knows about that file and color change to green 

Git Directory    git commit -m "added a file" now file has beeen added to the git  -m is for the message 

all these operation are inside the folder we want to store in the git 

if i delete the file then with help of commnad git restore "f.n" i can get that file back
